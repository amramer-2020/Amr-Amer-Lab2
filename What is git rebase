Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit
the rebase command integrates changes from one branch into another. It is an alternative to the better known "merge" command.
Most visibly, rebase differs from merge by rewriting the commit history in order to produce a straight, linear succession of commits

example :
integrate "dev" branch into master branch :
git checkout devfit rebase master
